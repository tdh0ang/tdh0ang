# Hello there

### About Me
I'm @tdh0ang, but I also go by Michael. I'm an Embedded Systems Aerospace Engineering student and I am looking to go into IT Security in the future.

### My Interests
I frequently take electric guitar lessons and play a lot. Usually metal, but I also like some more progressive stuff. Apart from that I also started
some music production, but on an amateur level, even though I would like to invest some more time into that. One thing that cannot be missing is gaming
I've been a big gamer since middle school and still play to this day, some of my favourites include Destiny 2, the Fallout series, Skyrim and Oblivion,
Battlefield and currently Genshin. 

### What I Am Learning
Right now I want to expand my knowledge on some cybersecurity stuff. All things about Linux and Networking for the beginning (shoutout to NetworkChuck btw).
Some projects right now are simple tutorials that I am following to improve and gain knowledge, so I can tackle more complex projects in the future.

### Collabing
Might probably the best way to exchange and gain knowledge, I would love to work on something!
